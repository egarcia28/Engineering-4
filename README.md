### Reflection

This was my first time coding in circuit python in a while, and my first time using the pico, so I was bound to run into issues. Thankfully, they were all relatively minor and I was able to figure them out. I had some trouble with the new file organization of the picos, I was trying to run code from a new vs code file, but learned that in order to run code on the picos, you have to use the code.py file found on the actual pico drive. I also had some trouble remembering how to use "for" loops, but after reading over [this site](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_for_range.asp) I was ablle to remember when and how to use them to help me finish this assignment.

## Raspberry_Pi_Launchpad_2

### Assignment Description

For this assignment we built upon [launchpad_1](#Raspberry_Pi_Launchpad_1) where we coded a countdown for a lauchpad, and added 2 LEDs to it. One red LED to blink as it counted down, and one green LED to signify liftoff.

### Reflection
I ran into very few issues while coding this portion of the assignment, and the issues I did encounter were very minor. For example,

## Raspberry_Pi_Launchpad_3

### Assignment Description

For this assignment we built upon [launchpad_1](#Raspberry_Pi_Launchpad_1) and [2](#Raspberry_Pi_Launchpad_2) where we coded a countdown and 2 LEDs for a launchpad. For this portion we added a button to signal the beginning of the countdown.

## Onshape_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Part Link 

[Create a link to your Onshape document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/003e413cee57f7ccccaa15c2/w/ea71050bb283bf3bf088c96c/e/c85ae532263d3b551e1795d0?renderMode=0&uiState=62d9b9d7883c4f335ec42021). Don't forget to turn on link sharing in your Onshape document so that others can see it. 

### Part Image

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
